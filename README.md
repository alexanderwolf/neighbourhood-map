Neighbourhood Map 
Built by Alex Twomey

Check out my South London pub recommendations. 

You can see their location, Google Places rating, if they're currently open and the weather at their location. 

Dynamic results are returned when you use the search box in the top-left corner.

This application uses the Google Maps API and its Places library for all location and pub data. For weather data, I leveraged OpenWeather's API.
